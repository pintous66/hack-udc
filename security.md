TherapIA Security

This page documents the security measures implemented in TherapIA, the AI-powered psychological chatbot.

Principles

TherapIA provides a secure environment to ensure user privacy and data protection. It follows strict authentication and authorization mechanisms to safeguard sensitive conversations.

The chatbot operates through a single secure interface where all users and applications must authenticate before accessing any service.
