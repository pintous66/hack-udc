TerapIA

What is TerapIA?

TerapIA is an AI-powered psychological chatbot designed to support users by providing mental health guidance. It interacts with users through chat, gathers profile information and diary entries, and analyzes each individual to offer personalized advice and emotional support.

What does TerapIA solve?

TerapIA aims to assist individuals facing emotional distress or seeking psychological support. While it is not a replacement for professional therapy, it provides a safe space for users to express themselves and receive guidance. It can also direct users to appropriate crisis resources when necessary.

How does TerapIA work?
